# Sportarr Plugin for Emby

A metadata provider plugin for Emby that fetches sports metadata from the Sportarr-API.

## Features

- **Series Provider**: Matches sports leagues/events to official metadata from sportarr.net
- **Episode Provider**: Provides episode-level metadata for individual sports events
- **Image Provider**: Fetches posters, banners, and fanart for sports content

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest `Emby.Plugins.Sportarr.dll` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Sportarr/Sportarr/releases)
2. Copy the DLL to your Emby plugins directory:
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/emby/plugins/`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Emby-Server\plugins\`
   - **Docker**: Mount to `/config/plugins/` in your container
3. Restart Emby Server

### Building from Source

```bash
cd agents/emby/Sportarr
dotnet build -c Release
```

The compiled DLL will be in `bin/Release/net8.0/Emby.Plugins.Sportarr.dll`

## Configuration

1. Go to Emby Dashboard → Plugins → Sportarr
2. Configure the Sportarr API URL (default: https://sportarr.net). Point this at a local Sportarr instance (e.g. `http://localhost:1867`) to serve metadata from your own install; it exposes the same API. Emby validates the URL against `/api/health`.
3. Optionally enable debug logging for troubleshooting

When pointed at a local instance, episode numbers come from the same source that wrote them into your filenames, so the metadata and the files stay in sync. Each event is resolved individually via `/api/metadata/match` rather than fetching the whole season list per file. The file name goes with the request, so a Sportarr id in it (`sportarr-ev-2338110`) names the event outright and the numbers only serve files without one.

## Usage

1. Create a TV Shows library for your sports content
2. In Library Settings → Metadata Downloaders, enable "Sportarr"
3. Move "Sportarr" to the top of the priority list
4. Refresh library metadata

## Requirements

- Emby Server 4.9 or later
- .NET 8.0 runtime

## Differences from Jellyfin Plugin

This is a separate plugin built specifically for Emby. Key differences:

- Uses `MediaBrowser.Server.Core` NuGet package instead of `Jellyfin.Controller`
- Uses `IHttpClient` and `HttpResponseInfo` instead of `IHttpClientFactory` and `HttpResponseMessage`
- Uses `ProviderIdDictionary` instead of `Dictionary<string, string>` for provider IDs
- Uses `LibraryOptions` parameter in `GetImages` method

## File naming, episode numbers, and verification

Sportarr organizes sports like a TV library: **League → Series**, **Season →
`Season {year}`**, **Event → Episode**. Name files:

```
<library root>/{Series}/Season {Season}/
{Series} - S{Season}E{Episode} - {Event Title} - {Quality}.ext

/sports/Formula 1/Season 2026/Formula 1 - S2026E12 - Bahrain Grand Prix - 1080p.mkv
```

Multi-part events (fighting cards, motorsport weekends) add a `ptN` segment:
`{Series} - S{Season}E{Episode} - pt{Part} - {Event Title} - {Quality}.ext`.

**Episode numbers come from Sportarr, and they can change.** An event's episode
number is its chronological position within the season (cancelled and postponed
events are skipped), so when the upstream schedule shifts, the number shifts:

- **Running the Sportarr app?** You don't name anything. Sportarr imports,
  names, and **renames** files automatically — when an event is added,
  cancelled, or postponed it renumbers the season and renames the files on disk
  on its next sync so the library stays correct.
- **Using only this plugin?** You name files yourself. Look up the current
  episode number at <https://sportarr.net/browse> (open a league → season) and
  name to match. Case and zero-padding don't matter (`S2026E12`, `s2026e12`,
  and `s2026e012` all resolve to episode 12). The Sportarr app's naming format
  is customizable under **Settings → Media Management**.
- **The Sportarr id wins.** Files the app names carry the event's id
  (`sportarr-ev-2338110`). Emby still needs season and episode numbers to
  recognize the file as an episode before the plugin runs. Once it does,
  the plugin sends the filename and the ID selects the exact catalog event.
  When naming by hand, include both `S2026E12` and the event's Sportarr ID.

### Verify it works

1. Place one correctly-named file in `{Series}/Season {year}/` (or let the
   Sportarr app import it) and refresh the library.
2. A correct match shows the right **episode number**, **poster**, **air date**,
   and **description**.
3. No match? Confirm the library is a **TV Shows** library, the `Season {year}`
   folder exists, and the number matches sportarr.net/browse, then use
   **Identify** to pick the league.
4. Episode number changed after a refresh? Expected — the schedule moved and
   Sportarr reflected it.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading
- Ensure you're using the Emby-specific plugin, not the Jellyfin version
- Check Emby logs for error messages
- Verify the plugin is in the correct directory

### Metadata not matching
- Enable debug logging in plugin settings
- Check Emby logs for `[Sportarr]` entries
- Ensure your folder naming matches the league/event names

## Endpoints Used

The Emby agent calls the hub's media-server-agent metadata API. The
endpoints below are media-server agnostic — the Plex and Jellyfin
plugins consume the same JSON.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/api/health` | Connection test |
| `/api/metadata/agents/search` | Search for leagues |
| `/api/metadata/agents/series/{id}` | Get league metadata |
| `/api/metadata/agents/series/{id}/season/{num}/episodes` | Get events for a season |
| `/api/metadata/match?series={id}&season={num}&episode={num}` | Resolve a single event (per-file lookup) |
| `/api/metadata/agents/episode/{id}` | Get event metadata (incl. resolved thumb_url) |
| `/api/images/league/{id}/poster` | League poster image |

The hub also keeps legacy `/api/metadata/plex/*` aliases (hidden from OpenAPI) for older agent versions; new code should use `/agents/*`.
