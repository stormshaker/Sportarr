# Sportarr Jellyfin Plugin

A metadata plugin for Jellyfin that fetches sports metadata from your Sportarr instance.

## Features

- **Rich metadata**: Posters, banners, fanart, descriptions, and air dates
- **Unified metadata**: Same data you see in Sportarr appears in Jellyfin
- **Multi-part support**: Handles fight cards (Early Prelims, Prelims, Main Card)
- **Motorsport support**: Practice, Qualifying, Sprint, Race sessions
- **Year-based seasons**: Uses 4-digit year format (2024, 2025) as season numbers

## Installation

### Option 1: Plugin Repository (Recommended)

The easiest way to install - Jellyfin will automatically check for updates!

1. In Jellyfin, go to **Dashboard** → **Plugins** → **Repositories**
2. Click **Add** and enter:
   - **Repository Name:** `Sportarr`
   - **Repository URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportarr/Sportarr/main/agents/jellyfin/manifest.json`
3. Click **Save**
4. Go to **Catalog** tab and find **Sportarr** under Metadata
5. Click **Install**
6. Restart Jellyfin

### Option 2: Download from Releases

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sportarr/Sportarr/releases)
2. Find the latest `jellyfin-plugin-v*` release
3. Download the `sportarr-jellyfin-plugin_*.zip` file
4. Extract the ZIP contents to your Jellyfin plugins folder:
   - **Docker:** `/config/plugins/Sportarr/`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\Sportarr\`
   - **Linux:** `~/.local/share/jellyfin/plugins/Sportarr/`
   - **macOS:** `~/.local/share/jellyfin/plugins/Sportarr/`
5. Restart Jellyfin

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
cd agents/jellyfin/Sportarr
dotnet build -c Release
```

Copy `bin/Release/net8.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.Sportarr.dll` to your plugins directory.

## Configuration

After installing the plugin:

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Plugins** → **Sportarr**
2. Configure settings:
   - **Sportarr API URL**: The Sportarr metadata API (default: `https://sportarr.net`). Point this at a local Sportarr instance (e.g. `http://localhost:1867`) to serve metadata from your own install; it exposes the same API.
   - **Enable Debug Logging**: Toggle for troubleshooting
   - **Image Cache Hours**: How long to cache images locally
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity
4. Click **Save**
5. Restart Jellyfin

When pointed at a local instance, episode numbers come from the same source that wrote them into your filenames, so the metadata and the files stay in sync. Each event is resolved individually via `/api/metadata/match` rather than fetching the whole season list per file. The file name goes with the request, so a Sportarr id in it (`sportarr-ev-2338110`) names the event outright and the numbers only serve files without one.

## Library Setup

1. In Jellyfin, go to **Dashboard** → **Libraries** → **Add Media Library**
2. Select **Shows** as the content type
3. Add your sports media folder (e.g., `/media/Sports`)
4. Under **Metadata Downloaders**, enable **Sportarr**
5. Drag **Sportarr** to the top of the list (highest priority)
6. Under **Image Fetchers**, enable **Sportarr**
7. Drag **Sportarr** to the top of the list
8. Click **OK**

## File Naming Convention

The plugin expects Sportarr's file naming format for best metadata matching.

### Folder Structure

```
{League}/Season {Year}/
```

Example:
```
UFC/Season 2024/
Formula 1/Season 2025/
Premier League/Season 2024/
```

### File Format

```
{League} - S{Year}E{Episode} - {Title} - {Quality}.ext
```

Examples:
```
UFC - S2024E15 - UFC 300 McGregor vs Chandler - 1080p.mkv
Formula 1 - S2025E05 - Monaco Grand Prix - 720p WEB-DL.mkv
Premier League - S2024E38 - Arsenal vs Chelsea - 1080p.mkv
```

### Multi-Part Events

Fighting sports and motorsport events can have multiple parts:

```
{League} - S{Year}E{Episode} - pt{Part} - {Title} - {Quality}.ext
```

**Fighting Sports:**
```
UFC - S2024E15 - pt1 - UFC 300 Early Prelims - 1080p.mkv
UFC - S2024E15 - pt2 - UFC 300 Prelims - 1080p.mkv
UFC - S2024E15 - pt3 - UFC 300 Main Card - 1080p.mkv
```

**Motorsport:**
```
Formula 1 - S2025E05 - pt1 - Monaco GP Practice - 720p.mkv
Formula 1 - S2025E05 - pt2 - Monaco GP Qualifying - 720p.mkv
Formula 1 - S2025E05 - pt3 - Monaco GP Race - 1080p.mkv
```

## Automatic naming, episode numbers, and verification

**Episode numbers come from Sportarr, and they can change.** An event's episode
number is its chronological position within the season (cancelled and postponed
events are skipped), so when the upstream schedule shifts, the number shifts:

- **Running the Sportarr app?** You don't name anything. Sportarr imports,
  names, and **renames** files automatically — when an event is added,
  cancelled, or postponed it renumbers the season and renames the files on disk
  on its next sync so the library stays correct.
- **Using only this plugin?** You name files yourself. Look up the current
  episode number at <https://sportarr.net/browse> (open a league → season) and
  name to match. Case and zero-padding don't matter (`S2026E12`, `s2026e12`,
  and `s2026e012` all resolve to episode 12). The Sportarr app's naming format
  is customizable under **Settings → Media Management**.
- **The Sportarr id wins.** Files the app names carry the event's id
  (`sportarr-ev-2338110`). Jellyfin still needs season and episode numbers
  to recognize the file as an episode before the plugin runs. Once it does,
  the plugin sends the filename and the ID selects the exact catalog event.
  When naming by hand, include both `S2026E12` and the event's Sportarr ID.

### Verify it works

1. Place one correctly-named file in `{Series}/Season {year}/` (or let the
   Sportarr app import it) and scan the library.
2. A correct match shows the right **episode number**, **poster**, **air date**,
   and **description**.
3. No match? Confirm the library type is **Shows**, the `Season {year}` folder
   exists, and the number matches sportarr.net/browse, then use
   **Identify** to pick the league.
4. Episode number changed after a rescan? Expected — the schedule moved and
   Sportarr reflected it.

```

1. **Scan**: Jellyfin scans your library and identifies shows/episodes
2. **Search**: Plugin searches Sportarr API for matching leagues
3. **Match**: Best match is selected based on name similarity and year
4. **Fetch**: Full metadata (descriptions, dates, ratings) is retrieved
5. **Images**: Posters, banners, fanart, thumbnails are fetched
6. **Display**: Rich metadata appears in your Jellyfin library

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading
- Check Jellyfin logs: **Dashboard** → **Logs**
- Look for `[Sportarr]` entries
- Verify the DLL is in the correct plugins folder
- Ensure you're running Jellyfin 10.9.x or later

### No Metadata Found
- Ensure files follow the naming convention above
- Check that your Sportarr instance is running and accessible
- Verify the API URL in plugin configuration
- Use **Test Connection** to verify connectivity

### Wrong Metadata Matched
- Use Jellyfin's **Identify** feature to manually search and select correct league
- Ensure series folder name closely matches the league name in Sportarr
- Check that the year in "Season YYYY" matches your event years

### Images Not Loading
- Verify Sportarr API URL is correct (include http:// or https://)
- Check if images load directly in Sportarr web UI
- Try increasing Image Cache Hours in plugin settings
- Check Jellyfin logs for image fetch errors

### Connection Test Fails
- Ensure Sportarr is running and accessible from Jellyfin server
- If using Docker, use the container name or host.docker.internal
- Check firewall rules allow connections on port 3000
- Verify the URL includes the protocol (http:// or https://)

## API Endpoints Used

The plugin communicates with these Sportarr API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/api/health` | Connection test |
| `/api/metadata/agents/search` | Search for leagues |
| `/api/metadata/agents/series/{id}` | Get league metadata |
| `/api/metadata/agents/series/{id}/season/{num}/episodes` | Get events for a season |
| `/api/metadata/match?series={id}&season={num}&episode={num}` | Resolve a single event (per-file lookup) |
| `/api/metadata/agents/episode/{id}` | Get event metadata (incl. resolved thumb_url) |
| `/api/images/league/{id}/poster` | League poster image |

These endpoints are media-server agnostic and shared with the Plex and Emby agents. The hub also keeps legacy `/api/metadata/plex/*` aliases (hidden from OpenAPI) for older agent versions; new code should use `/agents/*`.
