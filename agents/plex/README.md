# Sportarr Plex Integration

Sportarr provides two methods to integrate with Plex for sports metadata:

1. **Custom Metadata Provider** (Recommended) - For Plex 1.43.0+ (2024 and newer)
2. **Legacy Bundle Agent** - For older Plex versions

## Features

- **Rich metadata**: Posters, banners, descriptions, and air dates from sportarr.net (or a local Sportarr instance)
- **Unified metadata**: Same data you see in Sportarr appears in Plex
- **Multi-part support**: Handles fight cards (Early Prelims, Prelims, Main Card) and motorsport sessions
- **Year-based seasons**: Uses 4-digit year format (2024, 2025) as season numbers

---

## Option 1: Custom Metadata Provider (Recommended)

For Plex Media Server 1.43.0 and newer, use the new Custom Metadata Provider system. This is the recommended approach as it requires no file installation and will continue to be supported long-term.

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Add the Metadata Provider

1. Open **Plex Web** and go to **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Metadata Agents**
3. Click **+ Add Provider**
4. In the URL field, enter:
   ```
   https://sportarr.net/plex
   ```
5. Click **+ Add Agent**
6. Give it a title (e.g., "Sportarr Sports")
7. Select the **Sportarr** metadata provider you just imported
8. Click **Save**
9. **Restart Plex Media Server**

#### Step 2: Create a Sports Library

1. Go to **Settings → Libraries**
2. Click **+ Add Library**
3. Select **TV Shows** as the library type
4. Name it whatever you like (e.g., "Sports")
5. **Important:** Select the **Sportarr** metadata agent you created in Step 1
6. Add your sports media folder
7. Click **Add Library**

### Benefits of Custom Provider

- No files to install or update
- Automatic updates when sportarr.net improves
- Works with all Plex clients
- No restart required
- Survives Plex updates

## Option 2: Legacy Bundle Agent

For older Plex versions that don't support Custom Metadata Providers, use the legacy bundle agent.

> **Note**: Plex has announced that legacy bundle agents will be deprecated in 2026. We recommend migrating to the Custom Metadata Provider when possible.

### Installation

#### 1. Copy the Agent

Copy the `Sportarr-Legacy.bundle` folder to your Plex plugins directory:

**Windows:**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\
```

**macOS:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
```

**Linux:**
```
/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
```

**Docker:**
```
/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
```

#### 2. Restart Plex Media Server

After copying the bundle, restart Plex for the agent to be loaded.

#### 3. Create a Sports Library

1. In Plex, click **+** to add a library
2. Select **TV Shows** as the type
3. Add your sports media folder (e.g., `/media/Sports`)
4. Under **Advanced**, select **Sportarr (Legacy)** as the agent
5. Click **Add Library**

#### 4. (Optional) Point at a Local Sportarr Instance

The legacy bundle has a **Sportarr API URL** preference (Plex → plug-in
preferences). Leave it as `https://sportarr.net` to use the cloud, or set it
to your own instance (e.g. `http://localhost:1867`) to serve metadata
locally. A local instance exposes the same metadata API, and the episode
numbers it returns are the same ones it wrote into your filenames, so the
metadata stays in sync with your files.

---

## File Naming Convention

Both methods expect Sportarr's file naming format:

### Folder Structure
```
{Series}/Season {Season}/
```

Example:
```
My League/Season 2024/
My Sport/Season 2024/
```

### File Format
```
{Series} - S{Season}E{Episode} - {Title} - {Quality}.ext
```

Examples:
```
My League - S2024E15 - Event Title - 720p.mkv
My Sport - S2024E08 - Event Name - 1080p WEB-DL.mkv
```

### Multi-Part Events

Fighting sports events can have multiple parts (Early Prelims, Prelims, Main Card):

```
{Series} - S{Season}E{Episode} - pt{Part} - {Title} - {Quality}.ext
```

Examples:
```
My League - S2024E01 - pt1 - Event Title Early Prelims - 1080p.mkv
My League - S2024E01 - pt2 - Event Title Prelims - 1080p.mkv
My League - S2024E01 - pt3 - Event Title Main Card - 1080p.mkv
```

Motorsport events support up to 5 parts (Practice, Qualifying, Sprint, Pre-Race, Race).

## Automatic naming, episode numbers, and verification

**Episode numbers come from Sportarr, and they can change.** An event's episode
number is its chronological position within the season (cancelled and postponed
events are skipped), so when the upstream schedule shifts, the number shifts:

- **Running the Sportarr app?** You don't name anything. Sportarr imports,
  names, and **renames** files automatically — when an event is added,
  cancelled, or postponed it renumbers the season and renames the files on disk
  on its next sync so the library stays correct.
- **Using only this agent?** You name files yourself. Look up the current
  episode number at <https://sportarr.net/browse> (open a league → season) and
  name to match. Case and zero-padding don't matter (`S2026E12`, `s2026e12`,
  and `s2026e012` all resolve to episode 12). The Sportarr app's naming format
  is customizable under **Settings → Media Management**.
- **The Sportarr id names the show.** Files the app names carry the event's id
  (`sportarr-ev-2338110`). The metadata provider reads it to match the show,
  the way Plex reads a tvdb id in a folder name, so a folder named anything
  still lands on the right league. Plex then places each file by its season
  and episode numbers, as it does for every show, and Sportarr keeps those
  numbers current. The legacy bundle matches each file by its id.

### Verify it works

1. Place one correctly-named file in `{Series}/Season {year}/` (or let the
   Sportarr app import it) and scan the library.
2. A correct match shows the right **episode number**, **poster**, **air date**,
   and **description**.
3. No match? Confirm the library type is **TV Shows**, the `Season {year}`
   folder exists, and the number matches sportarr.net/browse, then use
   **Fix Match / Identify** to pick the league.
4. Episode number changed after a rescan? Expected — the schedule moved and
   Sportarr reflected it.

## How It Works

1. **Scan**: Plex scans your library and finds files matching the naming convention
2. **Parse**: Plex extracts series name, season, and episode from filenames
3. **Query**: Sportarr metadata provider is called with the show's name and the path of one of its files; a Sportarr id in that name names the league outright, otherwise the series name does. Episodes are placed by their season and episode numbers
4. **Fetch**: Full metadata (posters, descriptions, air dates) is retrieved from sportarr.net or your configured local instance. Each event is resolved individually via `/api/metadata/match` rather than pulling the whole season list per file
5. **Display**: Rich metadata appears in your Plex library

## Troubleshooting

### Custom Provider Not Working
- Verify Plex version is 1.43.0 or newer
- Check the provider URL is correct: `https://sportarr.net/plex`
- Ensure Plex server can reach sportarr.net (no firewall blocking)
- Make sure you restarted Plex after adding the provider
- Verify you selected the Sportarr agent when creating the library

### Legacy Agent Not Appearing
- Ensure the bundle is in the correct Plug-ins directory
- Check file permissions (Plex user must have read access)
- Restart Plex Media Server

### No Metadata Found
- Ensure your files follow the naming convention
- Check Plex logs for errors
- Try "Fix Match" to manually search and select the correct league

### Wrong Metadata
- Refresh metadata: Right-click item → "Refresh Metadata"
- Use "Fix Match" to manually select the correct league

## Migrating from Legacy to Custom Provider

1. Add the Custom Metadata Provider URL to your library (see Option 1)
2. Drag it above the legacy agent in the agent list
3. Refresh metadata on your library
4. Once verified working, you can remove the legacy bundle
