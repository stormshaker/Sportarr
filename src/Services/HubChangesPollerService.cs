/// Background service that polls the hub's entity changes feed and

///
/// The hub cannot push to installs (self-hosted, behind NAT, unknown to
/// the hub), so change propagation is pull: every cycle this service asks
/// "what changed since my cursor", maps the returned change records to
/// locally-monitored leagues, and syncs exactly the changed seasons —
/// historical ones included, since each change record names its season.
/// Reschedules, score updates, new events and dedup removals land within
/// one poll interval instead of waiting for the daily auto-sync or a
/// manual refresh click, and a change in a ten-year-old season costs one
/// targeted season fetch rather than a full league walk.
///
/// Feed gaps self-heal: when the hub answers "resync required" (first
/// poll ever, or a cursor older than the feed's retention window) the
/// poller reconciles every monitored league against full hub history
/// itself, so an install realigns to hub truth without the user knowing
/// cursor mechanics exist. Individual league sync failures advance the
/// cursor either way: a permanently failing league must not dam the
/// feed for the others.
