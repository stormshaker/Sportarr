/// Reported 2026-08-26: accepting a manual import moved the file instead of
/// hardlinking it, which broke an active seed. The reporter had
/// UseHardlinks on, one /data mount, and had checked that hardlinks work
/// inside the container.
///
/// The queue item the accept path built carried only DownloadClientId, never
/// the client itself. The import service asks the client whether the torrent
/// is still seeding, and with no client to ask it answers no, so the transfer
/// plan came out as Move. From their log:
///
///   [Import] Media management settings: CopyFiles=false, UseHardlinks=true
///   [Import] Transfer plan: "Move" - torrent is no longer tracked by the
///            download client
///   [Transfer] File moved: ...
///
/// The plan was already right for its inputs. The inputs were wrong.
